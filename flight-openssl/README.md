# Flight with OpenSSL

I have decided to learn a bit cryptography and OpenSSL library. 
I want to discover secure software world and apply new knowledge with some my side projects.
(Embedded systems and Linux, secure OS, blockchain and so on).


## Crypto Challenges that I have researched and have done:

**Set 1. Basics:**
1. [Convert hex to base64](https://cryptopals.com/sets/1/challenges/1)
2.


## How to use:
In progress.
